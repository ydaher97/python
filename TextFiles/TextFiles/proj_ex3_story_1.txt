In a far away kingdom, there was a river. This river
was home to many golden swans. The swans spent most of their time
on the banks of the river. Every six months, the swans would leave
a golden feather as a fee for using the lake. The soldiers of the
kingdom would collect the feathers and deposit them in the royal
treasury.
One day, a homeless bird saw the river. "The water in this river
seems so cool and soothing. I will make my home here," thought the
bird.
As soon as the bird settled down near the river, the golden swans
noticed her. They came shouting. "This river belongs to us. We pay
a golden feather to the King to use this river. You can not live
here."
"I am homeless, brothers. I too will pay the rent. Please give me
shelter," the bird pleaded. "How will you pay the rent? You do not
have golden feathers," said the swans laughing. They further added,
"Stop dreaming and leave once." The humble bird pleaded many times.
But the arrogant swans drove the bird away.
"I will teach them a lesson!" decided the humiliated bird.
She went to the King and said, "O King! The swans in your river are
impolite and unkind. I begged for shelter but they said that they
had purchased the river with golden feathers."
The King was angry with the arrogant swans for having insulted the
homeless bird. He ordered his soldiers to bring the arrogant swans
to his court. In no time, all the golden swans were brought to the
Kingâ€™s court.
"Do you think the royal treasury depends upon your golden feathers?
You can not decide who lives by the river. Leave the river at once
or you all will be beheaded!" shouted the King.
The swans shivered with fear on hearing the King. They flew away
never to return. The bird built her home near the river and lived
there happily forever. The bird gave shelter to all other birds in
the river.
