Long time ago, there lived a King. He was lazy and liked all the comforts of life. He never carried out his duties as
a King. “Our King does not take care of our needs. He also ignores
the affairs of his kingdom." The people complained.
One day, the King went into the forest to hunt. After having
wandered for quite sometime, he became thirsty. To his relief, he
spotted a lake. As he was drinking water, he suddenly saw a golden
swan come out of the lake and perch on a stone. “Oh! A golden swan.
I must capture it," thought the King.
But as soon as he held his bow up, the swan disappeared. And the
King heard a voice, “I am the Golden Swan. If you want to capture
me, you must come to heaven."
Surprised, the King said, “Please show me the way to heaven." “Do
good deeds, serve your people and the messenger from heaven would
come to fetch you to heaven," replied the voice.
The selfish King, eager to capture the Swan, tried doing some good
deeds in his Kingdom. “Now, I suppose a messenger will come to take
me to heaven," he thought. But, no messenger came.
The King then disguised himself and went out into the street. There
he tried helping an old man. But the old man became angry and said,
“You need not try to help. I am in this miserable state because of
out selfish King. He has done nothing for his people."
Suddenly, the King heard the golden swan’s voice, “Do good deeds and
you will come to heaven." It dawned on the King that by doing
selfish acts, he will not go to heaven.
He realized that his people needed him and carrying out his duties
was the only way to heaven. After that day he became a responsible
King.
